      Fleetwood Mac first formed in London, 1967.<br><br>
      Peter Green (following his exit from the John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers) - 
      at the time the Bluesbreakers consisted of Peter Green, Mick Fleetwood, 
      John McVie & John Mayall. Fleetwood, McVie & Green spent some time recording 5 songs, 
      using some free recording time gifted by Mayall. Shortly afterwards, Green suggested 
      to Fleetwood that they form a new band. <br><br>

      The pair named the band Fleetwood Mac in the hope of attracting McVie to join, but he declined - prefering the steady income from the Bluesbreakers
